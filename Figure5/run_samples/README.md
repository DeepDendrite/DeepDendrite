The code for generating Figure5.
run.py generate the spike probability figures as following:

1. Generate model with fully distributed spines, i.e. full spine models, under various clustered and distributed synaptic activations.

2. Simulate full spine models with DeepDendrite.

3. Calculate spike probabilities under multiple synaptic inputs, and plot the Spike Probability vs. Number of Activation Synapses figure for full spine models (save as "fig_prob_full_spine.png").

4. Generate few spine model under various clustered and distributed synaptic activations.

5. Simulate few spine models with DeepDendrite.

6. Calculate spike probabilities under multiple synaptic inputs, and plot the Spike Probability vs. Number of Activation Synapses figure for few spine models (save as "fig_prob_few_spine.png").
